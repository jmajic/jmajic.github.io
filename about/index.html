			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a second-year PhD student in Economics at MIT. Before starting at MIT, I spent a year as a pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Lab for Economic Applications and Policy, where I worked for Raj Chetty, John Friedman, and Nathan Hendren on projects in public economics using big data. In my own research, I'm interested in empirical work in both macro and micro.</p>
