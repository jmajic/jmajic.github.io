			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a first-year PhD student in Economics at MIT. I recently finished a year as a pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Lab for Economic Applications and Policy, where I worked for Raj Chetty, John Friedman, and Nathan Hendren on projects in public economics using big data. In addition to public economics, I also have interests in labor, development, macro, and political economy.</p>
