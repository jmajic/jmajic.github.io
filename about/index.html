			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Lab for Economic Applications and Policy, where I work on projects in public economics using big data. In addition to public economics, I also have interests in labor, development, macro, and political economy. I plan to pursue a PhD in economics starting in Fall 2016.</p>
