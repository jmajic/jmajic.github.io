<h5><a href="http://equality-of-opportunity.org/images/gender_paper.pdf">Childhood Environment and Gender Gaps in Adulthood</a></h5>
<p><em>American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings</em> 106(5): 282-88, 2016</p>
<p><span class="coauthor">with Raj Chetty, Nathan Hendren, Frina Lin, and Ben Scuderi</span></p>
<abstract>
We show that differences in childhood environments play an important role in shaping gender gaps in adulthood by documenting three facts using population tax records for children born in the 1980s. First, gender gaps in employment rates, earnings, and college attendance vary substantially across the parental income distribution. Notably, the traditional gender gap in employment rates is reversed for children growing up in poor families: boys in families in the bottom quintile of the income distribution are less likely to work than girls. Second, these gender gaps vary substantially across counties and commuting zones in which children grow up. The degree of variation in outcomes across places is largest for boys growing up in poor, single-parent families. Third, the spatial variation in gender gaps is highly correlated with proxies for neighborhood disadvantage. Low-income boys who grow up in high-poverty, high-minority areas work significantly less than girls. These areas also have higher rates of crime, suggesting that boys growing up in concentrated poverty substitute from formal employment to crime. Together, these findings demonstrate that gender gaps in adulthood have roots in childhood, perhaps because childhood disadvantage is especially harmful for boys.

<h5><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27935">A Q-Theory of Banks</a></h5>
<p><em>Under Revision for Review of Economic Studies</em></p>
<p><span class="coauthor">with Juliane Begenau, Saki Bigio, and Matias Vieyra</span></p>
<abstract>
We propose a dynamic bank theory with a delayed loss recognition mechanism and a regulatory capital constraint at its core. The estimated model matches four facts about banks' Tobin's Q that summarize bank leverage dynamics. (1) Book and market equity values diverge, especially during crises; (2) Tobin's Q predicts future bank profitability; (3) neither book nor market leverage constraints are binding for most banks; (4) bank leverage and Tobin's Q are mean reverting but highly persistent. We examine a counterfactual experiment where different accounting rules produce a novel policy tradeoff.

<h5><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3942967">Consolidation on Aisle Five: Effects of Mergers in Consumer Packaged Goods</a></h5>
<p><span class="coauthor">with Anthony Yu</span></p>
<abstract>
We study the effects of mergers in the consumer packaged goods industry, a sector that comprises approximately one-tenth of GDP in the United States. We match data on all recorded mergers between 2006 and 2017 with retail scanner data. In comparison to prior work, which focuses on case studies of large mergers, our approach allows us to estimate the effect of a typical merger. Most mergers we study are highly asymmetric (a large firm acquires a much smaller firm) and rarely challenged. By studying these mergers, we provide new evidence on the effects of mergers on prices, quantities, product availability, and exit. On average, mergers lead to a short-run price effect at the target of 1% and declines in total revenue of 7%. These average effects hide substantial heterogeneity across different groups of mergers. Our results highlight the importance of effects not captured in the canonical model, such as effects on consumer surplus through changes in product availability, and through inefficient firms' capital being repurposed by more productive acquirors.

<h5>What Can We Learn from Regional Data?</h5>
<p><em>New Draft Coming Soon</em></p>
<p><span class="coauthor">with Karthik Sastry</span></p>
<abstract>
Many prominent studies in macroeconomics, labor, and trade use panel data on regions to identify the local effects of aggregate shocks. These studies construct instruments as an observed aggregate shock times an observed regional sensitivity to that shock. We argue that the most economically plausible source of identification in these settings is uncorrelatedness of observed and unobserved aggregate shocks. Even when the regression estimator is consistent, we show that inference is complicated by cross-regional residual correlations induced by unobserved aggregate shocks. We suggest two-way clustering, Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors, and randomization inference as options to solve this inference problem, and we develop a feasible optimal instrument to improve efficiency. In an application to Nakamura and Steinsson (2014)'s analysis of regional fiscal multipliers, we show that the standard practice of clustering by region generates confidence intervals that are too small. When we construct confidence intervals with robust methods, we can no longer reject multipliers close to zero. The feasible optimal instrument more than doubles statistical power; however, we still cannot reject low multipliers. Our results underscore that the precision promised by regional data may disappear with correct inference.

<h5>Misallocation and the Selection Channel</h5>
<p><em>New Draft Coming Soon</em></p>
<abstract>
An important determinant of aggregate productivity is the selection channel: the process by which less efficient firms are driven out of the market by more efficient firms. Conventional wisdom suggests that markets in developing countries are more sclerotic, allowing inefficient firms to survive that would have exited in a developed country. I provide a tractable model to examine the importance of the selection channel, and show how to calibrate it to panel data on firms. I use this model to show that the effect of the selection channel on aggregate productivity is approximately equal to the average difference in log productivity between stayers and exiters, which can be measured easily in firm panel data. Results for Indonesia, Spain, Chile, and Colombia suggest that Indonesia could raise its aggregate productivity by roughly 30% if its firm exit process became as selective as Spainâ€™s. However, cross-country estimates suggest that the selection channel is not an important explanation for cross-country differences in output per capita.
