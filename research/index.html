				<strong>Does Ethnic Fractionalization Matter for Development?</strong>
				<br><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dv5w8b045eugpr1/ELF_Project_Instrument4.pdf?raw=1">Working Paper</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/igecmehwsvepw1k/ELF_Project_Slides.pdf?raw=1">Slides</a></em>

			<ul>
				<li>An existing literature finds that ethnic fractionalization (a measure of ethnic diversity) is negatively correlated with various development outcomes, including growth and public goods provision (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005). This paper attempts to deal with issues of endogeneity in work related to ethnic fractionalization. I use the recent literature on growth and political economy in order to identify a set of potential omitted variables, and I examine how controlling for these variables affects the estimated effect of fractionalization on growth. I also develop an instrument for fractionalization based on the arbitrary construction of African borders. Both methods generate evidence that the endogeneity of ethnic fractionalization causes substantial bias in regressions of growth on fractionalization, and the true effect is substantially smaller, although very difficult to estimate precisely. I develop a game theoretic model to explain how to reconcile micro-level evidence of harmful ethnic favoritism with macro-level effects of ambiguous sign.
