				<strong>Does Ethnic Fractionalization Matter for Development?</strong>

				<li>An existing literature finds that ethnic fractionalization (a measure of ethnic diversity) is negatively correlated with various development outcomes, including growth and public goods provision (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005). This paper attempts to deal with issues of endogeneity in work related to ethnic fractionalization. I use the recent literature on growth and political economy in order to identify a set of potential omitted variables, and I examine how controlling for these variables affects the estimated effect of fractionalization on growth. I also develop an instrument for fractionalization based on the arbitrary construction of African borders. Both methods generate evidence that the endogeneity of ethnic fractionalization causes substantial bias in regressions of growth on fractionalization, and the true effect is substantially smaller, although very difficult to estimate precisely. I develop a game theoretic model to explain how to reconcile micro-level evidence of harmful ethnic favoritism with macro-level effects of ambiguous sign.

				<strong>What can we learn from the financial flows of the 2008-2009 crisis?, w/ Saki Bigio and Juliane Begenau</strong>

				<li>We study the within financial system and bank-level flows recorded during the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and its aftermath. We collect the following facts: [1] at most $1.7 trillion assets left the shadow banking sector. [2] The commercial banking system increased its balance sheet in roughly the same amount. [3] The entire increase corresponds to an increase in reserves on the asset side and deposits on the liability side of commercial banks. [3] The Federal Reserve increased its holding of mortgage-backed securities by $1 trillion and treasury securities by  $0.9 trillion. Facts [1]-[3] suggest that the entire implosion of shadow banks was absorbed by the Federal Reserve but channeled through traditional banks. [4] Commercial banks suffered book equity losses that where exactly offset by preferred equity issuances. [5] They did show market-value equity losses of $450B. The cross-sectional analysis shows that: [6] At least in the short run, book equity did not capture the full extent of banks' losses and thus does not seem to have constrained banks. [7] Leverage is not constrained by market values. [8] Instead, book assets seem to be sticky. We draw on these observations to suggest guidelines for improving financial-macro models.</li>

				<strong>Childhood Environment and Gender Gaps in Adulthood (AER P&amp;P forthcoming), w/ Raj Chetty, Nathan Hendren, Frina Lin, and Ben Scuderi</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> We show that differences in childhood environments play an important role in shaping gender gaps in adulthood by documenting three facts using population tax records for children born in the 1980s. First, gender gaps in employment rates, earnings, and college attendance vary substantially across the parental income distribution. Notably, the traditional gender gap in employment rates is reversed for children growing up in poor families: boys in families in the bottom quintile of the income distribution are less likely to work than girls. Second, these gender gaps vary substantially across counties and commuting zones in which children grow up. The degree of variation in outcomes across places is largest for boys growing up in poor, single-parent families. Third, the spatial variation in gender gaps is highly correlated with proxies for neighborhood disadvantage. Low-income boys who grow up in high-poverty, high-minority areas work significantly less than girls. These areas also have higher rates of crime, suggesting that boys growing up in concentrated poverty substitute from formal employment to crime. Together, these findings demonstrate that gender gaps in adulthood have roots in childhood, perhaps because childhood disadvantage is especially harmful for boys.
