		I am an Associate Economist (postdoc) at the the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and a visiting scholar at Washington University in St. Louis. I graduated from MIT in May 2022, with a PhD in Economics. <br>
		<br>
		In July, I will join Notre Dame as a Postodoctoral Fellow in the Building Inclusive Growth (BIG) Lab.<br>
		<br>
		My research focuses primarily on empirical macroeconomics and development. Much of my research focuses on misallocation, firm behavior, and firm dynamics in a variety of settings.<br>
