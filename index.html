		I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Notre Dame. In Fall 2025, I will join the Notre Dame Department of Economics as an Assistant Professor. I graduated from MIT in May 2022, with a PhD in Economics. <br>
		<br>
		My research focuses primarily on macroeconomics and development. Much of my research focuses on misallocation, firm behavior, and firm dynamics in a variety of settings.<br>

		People often ask me how to pronounce my last name. I pronounce it "my-RO-vich," and it can also be pronounced "MY-er-wits."
