	<h1>Jeremy Majerovitz</h1>
	<p>I'm a third-year PhD student at the MIT Economics Department. Before starting at MIT, I spent a year as a pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Lab for Economic Applications and Policy, where I worked for Raj Chetty, John Friedman, and Nathan Hendren on projects in public economics using big data. In my own research, I'm interested in empirical work in macroeconomics and development.</p>
